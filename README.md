## Create a web app that uses an API

You will choose an API of your own choice but try to find one that you haven't used before. The important thing is that you have a listing page and accompanying detail page with commentary function. It doesn't matter if you list Pokemons or shoes ðŸ‘ž

You should: 

- Fetch a list of items from your API
- Add the possibility to navigate the items and show details
- The visitor should be able to comment on the detail pages, as well as delete comments
